Hello World! My name is Andrew Rafael James. I recently just graduated from my undergraduate degree at City University of Hong Kong, majoring in Finance. After graduation, I started my first job as a Data Analyst at Tokopedia, the largest e-commerce company in Indonesia. I have a profound interest in data analytics, from utilizing data to drive impactful decision to story-telling data in a presentable and insighftul mannner. 

Aside my keen interest in data, I also like reading books, playing badminton and binge-watching Netflix series. If you happen to know more about data, statistics, machine learning or anything related to operation reasarch, feel free to drop me a message on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewrafael/){:target="\_blank"}.
